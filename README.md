## moving screenshots to target directory
##
### target directory is the creation date of screenshot
### -- so you have a directory for each day of screenshots

My kind of learning needs sometimes screenshots, especially on online sessions.
I am used to have a daily subdirectory, given a name fetched by the date: built like that YYYYMMDD. 
For the case, that you are using the old "viona"-platform, the screenshots will be moved to the referring viona-directory.

So documents, files and screenshots are stored on a daily base.

If you like to use it, you need to change the directory path; see the comments in code.
